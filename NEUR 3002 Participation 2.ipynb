    "Temporal coding focuses primarily on the overall timing of spikes while rate coding focuses more on frequency and relative timing between spikes. Latency coding is also temporal, but just focuses on the first time delay in spiking. Synchronous depends more on comparison to another neuron, rather than just itself at a different point in time or with a different pattern. Population code takes into account many neurons rather than just one or a couple pairs to show total distributed activity. Finally, tuning curves are specific to certain stimuli and thus can be more directly useful in understanding the actual effects of stimuli on neural coding. "
